    \msec{Pushing against non-abelianness}
        Some falling animals land always on their hooves.\footnote{Due to dander
        allergies, we imagine a falling cow.}  The manifold $E$ of their
        postures in physical space fibers over the manifold
        $B$ of their internal muscle lengths.  Amazingly, even cows lacking
        angular momentum may traverse loops in $B$ that lift to non-loops in
        $E$!

    \msec{Connections as Forms}
        A \textbf{connection} on a bundle $\pi:E\to B$ is a prescription for
        how to lift infinitesimal paths through $\pi$.  We may lift finite
        paths by integrating --- this is \textbf{transport}.  A connection's
        \textbf{curvature} measures the failure of infinitesimal loops to lift
        to loops.  Thus, in the presence of curvature, the result of traversing
        a loop $\gamma$ times depends on $\gamma$; more generally, transport's
        destination in $E$ depends on one's path in $B$.

        A connection $\tilde\omega$ has type $TB \to E \to TE$ where we restrict
        to inputs whose basepoints match and we insist that the output vector
        projects to the input vector.
        %
        Thus, any two connections differ at $v \in T_p B$ by a vector field  on
        $p$'s fiber.  We may locally choose a flat connection $\tilde\omega_0$
        by choosing a trivialization of the bundle; then $\tilde\omega$ differs
        from $\tilde\omega_0$ at $v\in T_p B$ by some vector field $\omega(v)$
        on the fiber at $p$, Viewing all those vector fields as living in a Lie
        algebra $\gG$, we may package the data of $\tilde\omega$ as $\omega:TB
        \to \gG$.  Note that $\omega$ is only defined locally and depends on a
        local trivialization.

\newpage
    \msec{Curvature as a Form}
        Just as we measure infinitesimal location-dependence using one-forms,
        we measure infinitesimal path-dependence using two-forms.  We therefore
        expect the curvature $\Omega : \Lambda^2 TB \to \gG$ to be a two-form 
        valued in $\gG$.

        Intuitively, there are two obstructions to path independence:
        (\textbf{horizontal}) the connection might vary with $p$ and  
        (\textbf{vertical}) the vector fields $\omega(\cdot)$ might not
        commute.
        %
        To isolate the horizontal phenomenon, suppose $\gG$ is
        abelian so that transport is just addition in $\gG$.  We then
        want for disks $h: D^2 \to B$ that
        $$
            \int_{\partial h} \omega = \int_h \Omega
        $$
        In this case, we must take $\Omega = d\omega$.
        %
        To isolate the vertical phenomenon, suppose $\omega$ is closed, i.e.\
        in local coordinates constant.  Then for an
        infinitesimal rectangle in these coordinates with sides $u, v$, we
        want:
        $$
            e^{\omega(-u)}e^{\omega(-v)}e^{\omega(v)}e^{\omega(u)}
            =
            e^{\Omega(u,v)}
        $$
        In this case, we must take $\Omega(u,v) = [\omega(u), \omega(v)]$.
        %
        The general expression for \textbf{curvature} is a sum:
        $$
            \Omega(u,v) = d\omega(u,v) + [\omega(u), \omega(v)]
        $$

        For example, a Riemannian manifold $B$ of dimension $n$ has a bundle of
        orthonormal bases; the relevant algebra is $\oO(n)$.  Then
        $\Omega:\Lambda^2 TB \to \oO(n)$ has the same data as the Riemann
        tensor, and it emphasizes the variance and antisymmetries of the
        indices. 

    \newpage
    \msec{Chern's Gauss-Bonnet}
        Chern proved the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem using the curvature form for the
        bundle $UB$ of unit vectors on a (compact oriented) surface $B$. 

        The key insight is to lift this form by   

        Fix a vector field on $B$ with one non-degenerate zero at $p$.
        By Poincar\'e-Hopf, the zero has degree $\chi(B)$. 
        Regard the graph of the normalized vector field as a smooth
        submanifold $M$ of $U(B - \{p\})$; the boundary of $M$ winds around
        the $S^1$-shaped fiber $\chi(B)$ times.

        Then
        $$
            \int_B \Omega = \int_M \Omega
                          = \int_{\partial M} \omega
                          = \chi(B) \cdot \int_{S^1} \omega
        $$
        We finish by observing that $\int_{S^1} \omega = 2\pi$.

        Using double covers, we deduce that G-B also applies to non-orientable
        manifolds.

    \msec{Light}
        We will not mention, for
        instance, how a connection on a circle bundle elegantly describes
        light, its curvature form containing as components both the electric
        and magnetic fields. 

    \msec{Forms are Fun}
        There is much beyond this tiny tour.  All three of our main examples
        had $\gG$ abelian, so their curvatures' vertical terms vanished.

        We will not mention, for
        instance, that the nuclear forces arise from sphere
        bundles, their vertical terms indicating that ``nuclear
        light'' interacts with itself.  Nor will we remark that Chern's proof
        immediately generalizes beyond surfaces, thus relating geometry and
        topology in all even dimensions. 

        Sometimes the journey matters as much as the destination.  Let us
        explain this in the differential geometer's world where all that can be
        smooth is smooth and all that can be linear is linear.
